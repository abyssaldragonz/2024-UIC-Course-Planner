# Fall 2024 UIC-Course-Planner
Wired: WiCS 16-week Web Development Project

## ðŸš€ About
This is a dev project hosted by Women in Computer Science (WiCS) at University of Illinois Chicago. For the 16 weeks of the 2024 fall semester, a team will be building a planner site specifically for computer science students to plan out courses for their degree. The site includes a course catalog of the computer science and STEM courses required for a computer science degree at UIC, as well as a planner page for users to create their own schedules by adding courses to a specific semester/year.
